Infographic painting of neighborhood birds in Kistilano in March

Here is a subset of 8 the 23 species that I observed in my Kitsilano neighborhood during this project. Birds are painted in locations where I commonly observed them during my 13 birding outings (8.7hrs total). 

I was inspired to do this project when one of my roommates described a bird to me that she had seen in a tree in our back yard. When I showed her a photo of a Northern Flicker she said "Yes that's the one! Are they rare?". I proceeded to pull up the Merlin birding app and scroll through the Western Canada list, flipping my phone around everytime I saw a common Kitsilano bird so she could see. She was very patient with my overenthusiasm but I could tell that this method of information delivery was pretty tedious.

I decided that for this project, I wanted to create an infographic that was enjoyable to look at, and indicated how to find different birds in the neighbourhood.  

I went birding in the neighbourhood, took down notes of which species I saw and how many, photographed the species that I could, noted features that I found helpful when identifying them, and recorded where to look for each species (high up in the big maple trees, on the ground in the bushes, on the tips of cherry blossom branches etc). 

I chose 8 species to focus on for the painting and write ups (see the "Birds" tab). Out of the 8 birds in this painting, 6 are painted from photographs that I took during this project. 

During this project, I became comfortable identifying new bird species by song/call, I learned the typical behavours of common birds and where to expect them, and even met a couple of neighbours!

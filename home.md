Infographic painting of neighborhood birds in Kistilano in March

Here is a subset of 8 the 23 species that I observed in my Kitsilano neighborhood during this project. Birds are painted in locations where I commonly observed them during my 13 birding outings (8hrs 42mins total). 

I was inspired to do this project when one of my roommates described a bird to me that she had seen in a tree in our back yard. When I showed her a photo of a Northern Flicker she said "Yes that's the one! Are they rare?". I proceeded to pull up the Merlin birding app and scroll through the Western Canada list, flipping my phone around everytime I saw a common Kitsilano bird so she could see. She was pretty patient with my overenthusiasm but I could tell that this method of information delivery was pretty tedious.

I decided that for this project, I wanted to create an infographic that was enjoyable to look at, indicated which species of birds are in the area, simple features to identify them, and where someone would likely see them. I also wanted to find out how often someone might expect to see each species and how many on a given day. 

I went birding in the neighbourhood, took down notes of which species I saw and how many, photographed the species that I could, noted features that I found helpful when identifying them, and recorded where I saw each species (high up in the big maple trees, on the ground in the bushes, on the tips of cherry blossom branches etc). 

I chose 8 species to focus on for the painting and write ups (see the "Birds" tab). Out of the 8 birds in this painting, 6 are painted from photographs that I took during this project. 

While birding for this project, I quickly became comfortable identifying pine siskins, red-breasted nuthatches, dark-eyed juncos, northern flickers, and stellar's jays by song/call. I normally rely on my binoculars but by going out and listening to the same birds/looking things up many times in a row, I found myself confidently recording these species without having to see them. I also learned the typical behaviours of common birds and where to look for them, for example dark-eyed juncos send to be on or near the ground while pine sisking are high up in the trees.

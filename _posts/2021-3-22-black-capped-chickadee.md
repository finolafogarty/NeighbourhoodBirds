title: Black-capped Chickadee
---
Sex in painting: unknown. Males and females are sexually monomorphic.

Average seen per day (only including days with at least 1):	 6.3

Percentage of days this species was observed (out of 13 days): 100%

Distinctive Traits: Look for their distinctive black cap and throat. They have small bills and hunch more than other small songbirds. 

Where to look: I commonly see Black-capped chickadees between the base and middle of big maple trees in Kitsilano. They also frequent the tops of cherry blossom trees and other smaller deciduous trees along the street. 

Something I learned about this bird: 54% of all Black-capped Chickadees live in Canada!

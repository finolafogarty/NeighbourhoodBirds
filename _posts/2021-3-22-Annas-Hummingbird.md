title: Anna's Hummingbird
---

Sex in painting: male. Note rose-pink throat. Females have a grayish throat with some rose-pink spotting. 

Percentage of days this species was observed (out of 13 days): 62%

Average seen per day (only including days with at least 1): 1.3

Distinctive Traits: Both sexes are metallic green on head and back, greyish underneath with some green on sides. Males have distinct rose-pink throat and crown, and are more green underneath. Females have greyish throats with few pink spots, and are more grey underneath. 

Where to look: I find hummingbirds easy to spot by looking to the tops or outer branches of deciduous trees. They are often perched out in the open

Something I learned about this bird: males are easier to spot than females. Almost every hummingbird I saw during this project was a male.

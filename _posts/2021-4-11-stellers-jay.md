title: Steller's Jay
---

Sex in painting: unknown. Males and females are monomorphic.

Average seen per day (only including days with at least 1): 5.3

Percentage of days this species was observed (out of 13 days): 23%

Distinctive Traits:  These medium sized  birds have a tall black crest. Top half of them is black and the bottom half is blue. Unmistakeably gorgeous.

Where to look: Look up on the tops of tall coniferous trees where Stellerâ€™s Jays often perch. 

Something I learned about this bird:  I learned that there is an Interior subspecies that has white eyebrows and white stripes on their crest. Would love to see this!

Distinctive Traits: Both sexes are metallic green on head and back, greyish underneath with some green on sides. Males have distinct rose-pink throat and crown, and are more green underneath. Females have greyish throats with few pink spots, and are more grey underneath. 

Where to look: I find hummingbirds easy to spot if you look to the tops or outer branches of deciduous trees. They are often perched out in the open.
